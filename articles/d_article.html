    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p>The internet has rapidly evolved to become a profoundly powerful medium in its relatively short history, as
            Max Roser discusses in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/internet-history-just-begun">this</a> post for
            Our World in Data. Since the first computer-to-computer connection was established via the ARPANET in 1969,
            the internet has been adopted around the world much faster than previous technological innovations. We are
            now empowered by the capacity to share unprecedented amounts of information in the blink of an eye, thus
            integrating the planet and revolutionising how we communicate. The internet has encouraged engagement in
            civic and political life (D’Alessandro and Dosa, 2001; Jenkins et al., 2009)<sup>1, 2</sup>, and galvanized
            international trade. Such is the magnitude of this technological seismic shift that we are said to be
            experiencing a Digital Revolution that is characterised by a global ‘network society’ (Castells,
            2009)<sup>3</sup>.</p>
        <p>But while almost half of the world’s population now have access to the internet, some concerning trends in
            the diffusion of information and communication technology (ICT) have arisen: access to the internet is
            unevenly distributed, and the prima facie correlate is income. If left unchecked, this pattern threatens to
            offset the potential benefits of the internet, and even perpetuate pre-existing problems, as those who are
            unable to access the internet will become socially and economically isolated. This post discusses the nature
            and nuances of the Digital Divide.</p>
        <p>Firstly, it is worth noting that the so-called 'gap' in physical access to the internet has narrowed in
            recent years. This doesn’t illustrate the bigger picture, however. Recently, ICT scholars have widened the
            scope of the Digital Divide to include the quality of internet access – in terms of connection speed – as
            well as the technological competence of individuals.</p>
        <p>The following charts - produced by Kiln - offer a different perspective on the Digital Divide by illustrating
            differences in average internet capacity, or how much data each person can exchange through their device in
            each country at a given point in time. They clearly show that the Digital Divide in terms of bandwidth is
            not closing. South Korea has the highest average internet capacity with almost 17,000 kpbs, while the lowest
            is found in the island nation of Kiribati with 252.85 kpbs. In general, high income countries have an
            average bandwidth per person of almost 12,500 kbps, whereas lower income countries have about 250 kbps – to
            put this into perspective, it takes around 4,000 kbps to stream videos on Netflix (Hilbert and L&oacute;pez,
            2011)<sup>4</sup>. Interestingly, there is a positive correlation between international trade with the
            quantity and quality of internet access, and speed is more important for developing countries than the
            number of subscriptions (Abeliansky and Hilbert, 2016)<sup>5</sup>. And so when connection speeds by country
            are taken into account, the Digital Divide becomes more complex.</p>

        <p>Other studies have suggested that the difference in ICT skills access is also significant. Generally, they
            have revealed the range in skills is larger than that of physical access: while the latter is narrowing in
            developed countries, the former is in fact growing. Further interesting results are that there is positive
            correlation between traditional literacy and digital information skills, and that “people learn more of
            these skills in practice, by trial and error, than in formal educational settings” (van Dijk,
            2006)<sup>6</sup>. A lack of necessary technical knowledge may prevent people from using the internet in a
            socially or economically meaningful way.</p>
        <p>In review of the empirical evidence, one study explores the the Digital Divide by analysing the concrete
            developmental impacts of internet access on small businesses in Tanzania and South Africa. It found that the
            internet is mainly used for basic communication instead of producing or disseminated the type of information
            than can support innovation and industry. In summary, despite the penetration of mobile technology
            throughout the continent, “African industries are by-and-large thinly integrated into the global
            informational economy and ICT diffusion is doing little to reduce the economic inequalities that have marked
            the region’s relationship with the West, and now East, for decades.” (Murphy and Carmody, 2015)<sup>7</sup>
            The transformative potential of the internet is consequently wasted.</p>
        <p>Another study explores the consequences of unequal technological diffusion within a country. By using data
            from more than 12,000 households in rural India between 2005 and 2012, it determined the impact of the rapid
            spread of mobile phones – from 3% to 75% of households – on healthcare access for digitally excluded
            households. The result was that the “the fast pace of mobile phone diffusion makes it harder for poor people
            without phones to access essential health services. In other words, non-adopters are increasingly excluded
            from health services if everyone around them starts using mobile phones, leaving them worse off than before”
            (Haenssgen, 2018)<sup>8</sup>. New technologies can therefore create divides between poor parts of the
            population that weren’t previously there.</p>
        <p>It is wrong to assume that the number of people with internet access increasing means the Digital Divide is
            disappearing. The differences are in fact multidimensional. Each new technological innovation - like smarter
            devices or faster broadband – also engenders a new diffusion process, and so the gaps are constantly moving.
            There is little doubt that the internet has the potential to improve countless lives around the world, but
            this potential is too often wasted. In order to fully realise the transformative power of the internet, it
            is imperative that we acknowledge and understand the nature and nuances of the Digital Divide.</p><br>
